# Poor practice 1
- Description: Web Service Instance should be provisioned in the Private Subnet instead of Public Subnet.
- Reason: The ALB is forwarding the request to Web Service Instance, therefore it is not neccessary to public this instance.
- Solution: 
    + Provision Web Service instance in Private Subnet and only accept connection from ALB.
    + Web Service Instance can connect to Public S3 via NAT Gateway.

# Poor practice 2
- Description: The Secret Recipe S3 bucket is not enable Versioning and Server-Side Encryption.
- Reason: We need to store the secret information in secure way to prevent unauthorized access.
- Solution:
    + Enable versioning and Server-Side encryption by default.

# Poor practice 3:
- Description: The policy "InstanceRolePolicy-C3" is not least privileged.
- Reason: Currently it is assign Full permission to "InstanceRole".
- Solution: Only assign GetObject permission to InstanceRole since the Web Service Instance only need to read the recipe.

# Poor practice 4:
- Description: The security group "WebAppSG" is allow connection from everywhere.
- Reason: Currently it is configured allow '0.0.0.0/0' with ports: 22, 5000, 80, <all traffic>
- Solution:
    + Remove the rule All Traffic.
    + Denied port 80.
    + Allow port 5000 from Security Group of ALB only.
    + Denied 22.
