# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
Checkov: https://www.checkov.io/

### Example vulnerability
Example of Checkov rules:
- CKV_AWS_24: Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0:0 to port 22
- CKV_AWS_19: Ensure the S3 bucket has server-side-encryption enabled
- CKV_AWS_63: Ensure no IAM policies documents allow “*” as a statement’s actions

##Scan AMI’s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
Dagda: https://github.com/eliasgranderubio/dagda/
Anchore: https://anchore.com/

### Example vulnerability
- Known vulnerabilities CVE-XXXX-YYYYY. E.g:
    + https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-18017
    (The tcpmss_mangle_packet function in net/netfilter/xt_TCPMSS.c in the Linux kernel before 4.11, 
    and 4.9.x before 4.9.36, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and 
    memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging the presence of xt_TCPMSS 
    in an iptables action.)


##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
- AWS Inspector

### Example vulnerability
- Not enable encryption
- No encryption volumes
- Not allow SSH from 0.0.0.0
